### `npm build` to build the application,


## Project Structure

Project is divided into separate folders: 
    1. assets - are used for images and other static files,
    2. hooks - for reusable custom hooks, used across the app
    3. utils - are utility functions for writing helper functions
    4. components - for reusable components 

    components are divided into separate logical parts, sections folder are for the components which builds up the App page, and the rest should be reusable components
